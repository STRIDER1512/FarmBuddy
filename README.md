<h2>Introduction</h2>
In the Agriculture Sector there is always been a middle man between the customer and farmer,why should he be benefited??While the Farmer doesnt even getting the profits,if the farmer doesnt get profit who will sought the seeds for the next yield season?About 88% of the sucides of the farmers are because of the debt burden,if the farmer doesnt have enough money to grow the crops then who will grow the crops,farmer is the backbone of the country,if we are not supporting our farmers the country is not gonna withstand without the backbone.To sell the agriculture product the farmer has to go through these process FARMER-->CONTACT BUYER-->MEETING-->NEGOTIATION-->SAMPLE CHECK-->SALES CONTRACT-->ADVANCED PAYMENT-->PRODUCT LOAD-->TRUCK-->CUSTOMS-->SHIP-->BATCH CHECK-->UNLOAD-->TRUCK-->QUALITY CHECK-->DELIVERY-->FINAL PAYMENT-->SELLING TO VENDORS-->VENDORS SELLING-->LOCAL RETAILERS-->TO US(CUSTOMERS),This has to be the whole process for an agricultural product to reach from farmer to the customer,in this process the product may be damaged and the product may be surplused to the retailer sometimes there may be an inflation of the product,To overcome this problem Sriraj Tata,Srikar Tenneti,Tottara Dhanush and Himaja thought and brought a solution via web application that is FarmBuddy.
